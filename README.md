# Hindi Language Assistant 

This project presents a multimodal Hindi language learning assistant that combines retrieval-augmented generation with large language models to create an interactive and context-aware learning experience. By retrieving grammar rules, vocabulary, and usage examples from a curated corpus and blending them with generative outputs using chain-of-thought prompting, the assistant offers meaningful and adaptive responses. 
It supports both text and speech inputs to enable immersive written and spoken practice within natural conversational settings.
An agentic workflow manages tasks such as contextual conversations, dynamic lesson planning, and personalized feedback, making the system function like a responsive tutor. The user interface is built using Gradio for ease of use across all proficiency levels, and the language model is fine-tuned using LoRA to specialize in Hindi while maintaining efficiency. 
This project addresses the lack of intelligent tools for Hindi learners, offering a scalable and culturally relevant solution for language education.
